# --- IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAINTAINERS ---
# The packages below (especially fastapi and uvicorn) are pinned to older versions
# that are INCOMPATIBLE with Python 3.12 and will cause a runtime error.
#
# To fix this, the Docker build process intentionally uses the '--upgrade' flag
# in 'build/COPY_ROOT_1/opt/ai-dock/bin/build/common.sh' during the pip install.
#
# DO NOT REMOVE THE --upgrade FLAG FROM THE BUILD SCRIPT UNLESS YOU MANUALLY
# UPDATE THE VERSION NUMBERS IN THIS FILE.
